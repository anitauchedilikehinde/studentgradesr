This report analyzed student grades data to identify the most important factors associated with a student passing or failing the assessment. While several relationships were discovered between the different heterogenous factors given, most of these were weak and not significant. In addition to descriptive analysis, four non-parametric models namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost models were utilized to build several models using an 80% train-test split and backward feature selection method. Several factors such as age, parent’s education, number of previous failures, going out with friends and alcohol consumption were identified by each model as important factors that influence assessment outcome while nursery(whether the student attended nursey school), school, access to internet, higher (intention to attend higher education) were not found to significantly affect student grades. It was suggested that feature extraction and cross validation be utilized in place of feature selection to compare the models’ performance.
